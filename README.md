# Predicting Credit Risk

A machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not was built. Data was used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier was compared.

## Reflection/ Reporting 
I predict that the Logistic Regression model will perform better on the data since the data is numerical data and Logistic Regression model works better for numerical data while Random Forest Classifier works better for categorical data. Also, Logistic Regression performs better when the number of noise variables is less than or equal to the number of explanatory variables and Random Forest has a higher true and false positive rate as the number of explanatory variables increases in a dataset.

However, the results from both models shows that the Random Forest Classifier performed better since it had a higher score than the Logistic Regression model score.
