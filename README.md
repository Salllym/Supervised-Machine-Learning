# Predicting Credit Risk

Data was used to create machine learning models to predict whether a loan will be approved or not and classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier was compared.

## Reflection/ Reporting 
I predicted that the Logistic Regression model will perform better on the data since the data is numerical data and Logistic Regression model works better for numerical data while Random Forest Classifier works better for categorical data. Also, Logistic Regression performs better when the number of noise variables is less than or equal to the number of explanatory variables and the Random Forest Classifier has a higher true and false positive rate as the number of explanatory variables increases in a dataset.

However, the results from both models shows that the Random Forest Classifier performed better since it had a higher score than the Logistic Regression model score, which wasn't what I predicted.
